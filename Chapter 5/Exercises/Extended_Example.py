#In this problem, you'll be asked to read through an object-oriented implementation of the
#hand from the word game problem of Problem Set 4. You'll then be asked to implement one of its
#methods. Note that the implementation fo the object-oriented version of the hand is a bit different 
#than how we did things with the functional implementation; pay close attention to the doc strings
#and read through the implementation carefully.
